# Maintenance Guidelines for Quirgs

As the site grows with more guides and features, consider these recommendations for maintainability:

## CSS Organization

1. **Consider modularizing CSS**:
   - Split `styles.css` into multiple files (base, layout, components, utilities)
   - Consider adopting a methodology like BEM, SMACSS, or Tailwind
   
2. **Use CSS variables consistently** (already good with `--variable-name`)

## JavaScript Management

1. **Move to external JS files**:
   - Create a `js` directory
   - Extract navigation logic to `navigation.js`
   - Create component-specific JS files

2. **Consider using ES modules** for larger features

## Guide Management

1. **Template system**:
   - Consider a simple template approach for new guides
   - Store guide metadata separately (JSON/YAML) for easier management

## Performance Considerations

1. **Image optimization** as more guides are added
2. **Lazy loading** for guide cards and images
3. **Consider code splitting** if JavaScript grows significantly

## Accessibility Checklist for New Content

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- Include alt text for all images
- Maintain color contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)
- Test keyboard navigation
- Add ARIA attributes to custom interactive elements

## Security Checklist for New Features

- Add rel="noopener noreferrer" to external links
- Validate and sanitize any user input
- Consider adding Content-Security-Policy headers
- Keep dependencies updated

## Browser Compatibility

- Test in multiple browsers
- Consider feature detection for newer APIs

This document will help maintain consistency as the site grows.
