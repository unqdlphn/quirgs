## About Quirgs

Quirgs (Quick Reference Guides) is a collection of elegantly formatted, practical reference materials for developers. Created out of the need for clearer, more accessible documentation, Quirgs aims to make technical information beautiful and instantly useful.

## Our Story

Every developer knows the frustration of digging through lengthy documentation to find that one command or parameter they need. Quirgs was born from this shared experience - the belief that reference materials should be:

- **Scannable** - Find what you need in seconds
- **Comprehensive** - Cover all the essential information
- **Beautiful** - Designed with care and attention to detail
- **Accessible** - Available wherever you need them

## Current Features

### GitHub Copilot Commands Reference

Our flagship reference guide covers everything you need to know about interacting with GitHub Copilot:

- **Slash Commands** - Quick access to Copilot's core functionality (`/fix`, `/explain`, `/tests`, etc.)
- **Context Commands** - How to reference your workspace, files, and selections
- **Intent Commands** - Different ways to express what you need from Copilot
- **Best Practices** - Tips for crafting effective prompts
- **Advanced Usage** - Command combinations and advanced techniques
- **Interface-Specific Commands** - Shortcuts and features for VS Code and GitHub.com
- **Troubleshooting** - Solutions to common issues

## Design Philosophy

Each Quirgs guide follows these principles:

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy** - The most important information stands out
2. **Consistent Structure** - Predictable organization makes navigation intuitive
3. **Practical Examples** - Real-world usage examples, not just syntax
4. **Mobile-Friendly** - Accessible on any device, when you need it
5. **Color Scheme** - A soothing palette that enhances readability. https://coolors.co/2f4f4f-fb3640-79addc-fde74c
